# List-Operation
This notebook offers a comprehensive overview of Python list operations, serving as a foundational resource for mastering one of Python's most versatile data structures. It covers list creation, indexing, slicing, and modification using methods like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), and sort(). It also demonstrates how to iterate through lists using loops, utilize list comprehensions for concise code, and work with nested lists effectively. This exercise is part of my broader Python learning journey, aimed at strengthening core programming skills and preparing for real-world data analysis and software development tasks.
